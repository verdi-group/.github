# Verdi group

Welcome to the Verdi group's GitHub organization! ðŸ‘‹
This is where we host the code we develop in our group:

- [`plumipy`](https://github.com/verdi-group/plumipy): Python package for calculating photoluminescence spectra from constrained DFT.

>[!NOTE]
> We only just started collaboration on GitHub, so it's still very quiet here!
> Expect more code and documentation to be published here in the coming months.
