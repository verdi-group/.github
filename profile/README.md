# Verdi group

Welcome to the Verdi group's GitHub organization! 👋
This is where we host the code we develop in our group:

- [`plumipy`](https://github.com/verdi-group/plumipy): Python package for calculating photoluminescence spectra from constrained DFT.
- [`aiida-pl`](https://github.com/verdi-group/aiida-pl): Workflows for calculating the required inputs for the `plumipy` code.
- [`aiida-defects-neb`](https://github.com/verdi-group/aiida-defects-neb): Workflows for calculating transition barriers of defect migrations.

>[!NOTE]
> We only just started collaborating on GitHub, so it's still very quiet here!
> Expect more code and documentation to be published here in the coming months.
